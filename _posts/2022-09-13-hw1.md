# Practice Post

## Different writing formats
Here I will try out multiple ways to stylaize writes. 
**This is bold text**
*This is italicized text*
~~You can cross through text~~
***This text is bold an italic***
<sub>This text is a subscript</sub>

##Typing with quotes
This text is normal but a quote can be added in as such. 
> This text is now a quote

##To create a link
You can wrap the text in brackets that will have a link but put the actual link in parentheses.
