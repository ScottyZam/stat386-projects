# Practice Post

## Different writing formats

Here I will try out multiple ways to stylaize writings. 

**This is bold text**

*This is italicized text*

~~You can cross through text~~

***This text is bold an italic***

<sub>This text is a subscript</sub>

## Typing with quotes
This text is normal but a quote can be added in as such. 

> This text is now a quote

## To create a link
You can wrap the text in brackets that will have a link but put the actual link in parentheses.
