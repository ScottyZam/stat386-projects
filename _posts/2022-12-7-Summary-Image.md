## Summary of the "Natural Disasters" data project
The Natural Disasters dataset was originally scraped from this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_in_the_United_States), using the pandas package. The data was very messy and required a lot of data cleaning and manipulation. The final output of the dataset consisted of two quantitative and three categorical columns of neat data concerning major natural disasters in the United States. Once the clean dataset was obtained, it was extensively explored with visualizations, tables, and summary statistics. This part of the project is crucial to better understand the data and is called; Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
EDA is the first step in understanding the data and learning what kind of story can be told with it. Visualizations are the best tools to tell those stories that are discovered which was the final portion of the project. After sufficient EDA I summarized an important story with one final image, so anyone can see the image and understand the what the data was telling us. 

## Data Story
The most prominent natural disasters found within the data fell into four categories; Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Wildfires, and Blizzards. These four disasters were very common throughout many years and unfortunately took many lives. I mapped the death tolls for each of these four categories against a timeline to understand if these disasters were claiming more lives now or in the past. The data shows an initial and significant decline in deaths for each of the four groups but small spikes in more recent years. It is apparent that each of these four common natural disasters were major problems for Americans but overtime the public figured out how to better prepare and survive all of the common natural disasters. Though the deaths have drastically declined over the years, the somewhat recent spikes may be due to large populations of people in cities that are prone to hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and wildfires. This analysis ssuggests that the American public has become much better at surviving natural disasters over the years, but with increasing populations, the U.S. will need to be even more prepared for future natural disasters.

## Conclusion
This summary of the data was focused in on one specific aspect that I thought was most important. The beauty with data is there are seemingly endless options for exploration and prediction. I hope you enjoyed scrapping, exploring, and understanding this data with me and if you have any suggestions on what I could have done differently or what I could do in future posts, please let me know in the comments.
