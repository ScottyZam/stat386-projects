# What is regression and why should I care?

Regression is a type of statistical modeling that describes the relationship between a dependent variable (a.k.a. the target variable) and independent variables (a.k.a. predictor variables). The most common use of regression is identifying the influence that variables have on one another and then utilizing that to predict future outcomes.

The tricky part about regression is there are many different types, which are all meant for specific kinds of data. If one were to use an incorrect type of regression on a certain dataset then the model would not fit well, leading to incorrect outcomes. In this post I will explain the process of choosing the correct type of regression. The best way to do this is to first pay attention to your dependent (target) variable and identify if it is continuous, categorical, or some type of counting variable. 

This post will be organized by the data type of the dependent variable. You can find sub-headings for continuous, categorical, and counting dependent variables. Under each sub-heading, you can find multiple types of regression to best fit your data. 

# Dependent Variables:

## 1. Continuous Dependent Variables

If your dependent variable is continuous such as weight, distance, or time.

### Simple Linear Regression - 
Simple Linear Regression is the basic ground work for other, more complicated, types of regression. Use this when there seems to be a linear relationship between an independent variable and a continuous dependent variable. This model clarifies the mean change in the dependent variables per one unit change in the independent variable. This is done by putting a line through the data with that minimizes the sum of the squared errors on either side. This method makes simple linear regression easily influenced by outliers, which means this may not fit the data well when using large amounts of data containing outliers. 

### Multiple Linear Regression - 
Similar to Simple Linear Regression, this type of regression differs in estimating the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The dependent still needs to be continuous but the independent variables can be either continuous or categorical and the data will be modeled similarly to Simple Linear Regression. When using Multiple Linear Regression, be aware of multicollinearity within the independent variables as this may undermine the significance of the variables. 

### Ridge Regression - 
Ridge Regression is the best method to use when the data does have high multicollinearity because it uses a regularization technique to reduce the complexity of the model. This eliminates a lot of the variance, caused by multicollinearity, but introduces a small amount of bias in the estimates. Ridge Regression models the data by adding an "L2 penalty" which essentially shrinks all of the coefficients by the same factor, resulting in none of the coefficients being eliminated. 

### Lasso Regression - 
Lasso Regression is very similar to Ridge Regression but it offers a way to do variable selection. This is done by prohibiting the size of the coefficient, causing the values to become closer to zero. Lasso Regression enhances the prediction accuracy and allows the model to become more interpretable. 

### Partial Least Squares Regression - 
Partial Least Squares Regression is used when the data has high multicollinearity or when you have a small amount of observations compared to the number of independent variables. It works by decreasing the independent variables down to a few uncorrelated components, then running linear regression on these components. An interesting aspect of Partial Least Squares Regression is one can include multiple dependent variables as long as they are all continuous.  

### Polynomial Regression - 
Polynomial Regression is used to model a non-linear dataset while still using a form of a linear model. The model works by transforming the data points of the independent variables into polynomial features, then best fitting a curve to the data instead of a line. The purpose of this curve is to minimize the sum of the squared errors just like regular linear regression, but because of the specificity of the polynomial functions, Polynomial Regression is well prone to overfitting. 

## 2. Categorical Dependent Variables

If your dedependent variable is categorical such as size levels, yes or no responses, or groupings.

### Logistic Regression - 
Logistic Regression is the standard form of regression when the dependent variable is categorical. It works by utilizing maximum likelihood estimation rather than least squares. Logistic Regression itself has multiple methods categorized underneath it due to the variety of data types within categorical data. All of these types of Logistic Regression work sery similarly but with small differences which is why I will only list how they all differ. 

### Binary Logistic Regression - 
Binary Logistic Regression measures the relationship between independent variables and a binary dependent variable. The binary variable is often a yes or no response with this analysis. 


### Ordinal Logistic Regression - 
Ordinal Logistic Regression is used to measure the relationship between independent variables and an ordinal target variable, meaning at least three groups that follow a natural order. An ordinal dependent variable would be something similar to small, medium, and large sizes. 

### Nominal Logistic Regression - 
Nominal Logistic Regression is used the same way as Ordinal but the dependent variable is nominal, meaning it has at least three groups that have no natual order to them. An example of a nominal dependent variable would be movie categories such as comedy, action, or drama. 

## 3. Count Dependent Variables
If your dependent variable is considered count data such as number of time someone goes to the gas station in six months.

### Poisson Regression - 
Poisson Regression is the most common type of regression when analyzing count data. They are similar to Logistic Regression in the way they use maximum likelihood estimation but they're best used with rate data. An example of this "rate data" would be the number of customers visit a restaurant in a given day. 

### Negative Binomial Regression - 
Negative Binomial Regression is very similar to Poisson Regression but is commonly used when one of the poisson assumptions cannot be met by the data. Overdispersion is when the variance is greater than the mean, making the poisson model inacurate. Negative Binomial Regression is not effected by this problem and the outcome can be used and interpreted similarly as Poisson Regression.  

### Zero Inflated Regression - 
Zero Inflated Regression models are best when one would use Poisson Regression but there are too many zeros in the dataset, making the distribution differ from Poisson. This method works by assuming two different processes produced all of the zeros and will account for them separately. The process accounting for less zeros is then passed to a Poisson Regression model. 

# Takeaways For Your Regression Models

Regression is a powerful and extremely useful type of statistical modeling that can be used in many different scenarios. To tap into the potential of these models in your day to day life, make sure an find the mest model to fit your data. Remember to identify the data type of your target variable and then identify the proper characteristics of your data to match it with its best model. 

It is common for analysts and data scientists to narrow down the options to multiple types of regression then test a few models before finding the best model for the job at hand. Feel free to practice using different datasets and better understanding the specific quirks of each type of regression. 

I hope you use this as a guide to help plan out your next regression analysis, and please let me know if there is any clarifications you would like to see.
