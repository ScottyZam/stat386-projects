# What is regression and why should I care?

Regression is a type of statistical modeling that describes the relationship between a dependent variable (a.k.a. the target variable) and independent variables (a.k.a. predictor variables). The most common use of regression is identifying the influence that variables have on one another and then utilizing that to predict future outcomes. 

The tricky part about regression is there are many different types, which are all meant for specific kinds of data. If one were to use an incorrect type of regression on a certain dataset then the model would not fit well, leading to incorrect outcomes. In this post I will explain the process of choosing the correct type of regression. The best way to do this is to first pay attention to your dependent (target) variable and identify if it is continuous, categorical, or some type of counting variable. 

This post will be organized by the data type of the dependent variable. You can find sub-headings for continuous, categorical, and counting dependent variables. Under each sub-heading, you can find multiple types of regression to best fit your data. 

# Dependent Variables:

## 1. Continuous Dependent Variables

If your dependent variable is continuous such as weight, distance, or size.

### Simple Linear Regression - 
Simple Linear Regression is the basic ground work for other, more complicated, types of regression. Use this when there seems to be a linear relationship between an independent variable and a continuous dependent variable. This model clarifies the mean change in the dependent variables per one unit change in the independent variable. This is done by putting a line through the data with that minimizes the sum of the squared errors on either side. This method makes simple linear regression easily influenced by outliers, which means this may not fit the data well when using large amounts of data containing outliers.
